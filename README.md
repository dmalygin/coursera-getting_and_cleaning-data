# Description of project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/home/welcome) course
---
>In this project we are going to download data set which contains variety of variables generated by special trackers of physical activities worn on body by 30 different persons. 
Detailed steps of the manipulation on the data set are described below.

### The purpose of the project:
- to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set

### The goal of the project:
- to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

### Review eligibility for the project:
1. The submitted data set is tidy.
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
5. he work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

### List of files for the project:
| â„– | TITLE |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | [README.md](https://github.com/dmalygin/coursera-getting_and_cleaning-data/blob/master/README.md) |
| 2 | [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/dmalygin/coursera-getting_and_cleaning-data/blob/master/CodeBook.md) |
| 3 | [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/dmalygin/coursera-getting_and_cleaning-data/blob/master/run_analysis.R) |

### Steps of the project:
1. Launch the script 'run_analysis.R'
    1. The script will download automatically the [.zip archive with the data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)  
    2. The script will unzip the archive
    3. The script will read 8 required data files into a memory for further operations:
        + activity_labels.txt
        + features.txt
        + subject_train.txt
        + X_train.txt
        + Y_train.txt
        + subject_test.txt
        + X_test.txt
        + Y_test.txt
    4. The script will perform necessary operations
    5. As a result of the work the file [tidy_dataset_human_activities.txt](https://github.com/dmalygin/coursera-getting_and_cleaning-data/blob/master/tidy_dataset_human_activities.txt) will be written by script
